### Probelm 1
You have 10 lymphoblastic cell lines, as well as transcript counts for a gene of interest at baseline and after stimulation.

```{r}
individual = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)
baseline = c(-0.24, 0.25, 1.12, -0.06, 0.46, 0.17, 0.02, 1.10, 0.55, 0.98)
stimulated = c(1.74, 2.1, 1.65, 2.65, 3.11, 2.31, 1.87, 3.21, 2.19, 1.75)
stim_data = data.frame(individual, baseline, stimulated)
```

#### 1a
Perform a one sample t-test comparing baseline to zero.
The null hypothesis is that the sample mean is not different from zero.
The althernative hypothesis is that the sample mean is different from zero.
