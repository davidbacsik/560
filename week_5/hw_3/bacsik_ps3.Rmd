### Problem 1
In homework 2, you were investigating the de novo mutation rate of R. Waterstonii.
In a given generation, you observed the following mutation counts in 12 different
isolates:

```{r}
mutations = c(12,15,10,4,6,15,18,12,7,11,5,14)

mutation_data = data.frame(mutations)

mutation_data

```

#### 1a
**Obtain 1,000 bootstrap samples from your data and recompute Î»' for these bootstrap examples.**

```{r}
library(boot)

lambda_estimates = boot(mutation_data, statistic = mean, R=1000)

lambda_estimates
```
